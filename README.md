## The Personal Page
This simple one-page website is a way for people to have a very quick and easy personable website that aggregates your activity and positions a simple logo, a portrait and some description text in a nicely-formatted manner.

## Usage
1. Edit the `index.html` file with your own text.
2. Replace `monogram.png` with your own logo. Your initials will likely not be NH, but if they are, be smart and use your own little monogram/logo.
3. Replace `nh.bg` with your own portrait for the background. Don't impersonate me!
4. You can switch the position of the monogram and text as seen in http://timlum.com.
5. Upload all the files on your server, including the MIT and GPL licences.
6. If you don't have a server, you can use [github pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages). It's free.
